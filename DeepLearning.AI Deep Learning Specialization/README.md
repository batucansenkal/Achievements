# DeepLearning.AI Deep Learning Specialization

**Instructors: Andrew Ng, Kian Katanforoosh, Younes Bensouda Mourri**

The Deep Learning Specialization is a foundational program that will help you understand the capabilities, challenges, and consequences of deep learning and prepare you to participate in the development of leading-edge AI technology. 

This program includes:

• Deep neural networks, vectorized neural networks, architecture parameters.
• Bias/variance for building Deep Learning applications, standard NN techniques, optimization algorithms, and neural networks in TensorFlow.
• Strategies for reducing errors in ML systems, complex ML settings, and end-to-end, transfer, and multi-task learning.
• Convolutional Neural Network, visual detection and recognition tasks, neural style transfer to generate art.
• Recurrent Neural Networks and its variants (GRUs, LSTMs), RNNs to character-level language modeling, NLP and Word Embeddings, and HuggingFace tokenizers and Named Entity Recognition and Question Answering.
