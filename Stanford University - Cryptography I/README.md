# Stanford University - Cryptography I

**Instructor: Dan Boneh**

Cryptography is an indispensable tool for protecting information in computer systems. In this course you will learn the inner workings of cryptographic systems and how to correctly use them in real-world applications. The course begins with a detailed discussion of how two parties who have a shared secret key can communicate securely when a powerful adversary eavesdrops and tampers with traffic. The second half of the course discusses public-key techniques that let two parties generate a shared secret key.
